# Chat-App
Chat-App is a real-time chat application built using Node.js, Express, and Socket.io. It allows users to join chat rooms, exchange messages, and see a list of online users in each room. This project is part of my web development portfolio and was created to demonstrate my skills in web development and real-time communication.


Chat-App is a real-time chat application that utilizes websockets with Node.js, Express, and Socket.io. It offers a custom user interface built with Vanilla JavaScript on the frontend. You can easily run the application on Repl.it for seamless chat interactions.
